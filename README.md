## bearbnb Introduction

bearbnb is a full stack application that simulates a local, Big Bear, California property reservation site. Allowing owners to create properties and upload photos via  [Amazon S3 media sharing](https://aws.amazon.com/media-sharing/).

Potential guest can brows properties and create reservations. While this site is fairly simple, it was my first solo project built in one week. bearbnb is a tongue in cheek application that pokes fun at the locals obsession with naming everything with a bear in it.
